## Goal
The main goal of this repository is to examine how the ASP.NET Core + Angular template works. Also, it can be a great opportunity to build a simple 'yet another blogging system' ü§∑‚Äç.

## Plans
- The fully working authentication and authorization system
- Back-end written in C# using ASP.NET Core
- Front-end written in TypeScript using Angular and Bootstrap
- Creating the posts
- Grouping the posts into the categories
- Tags system
- Simple admin panel (mostly simple CRUDs so far)
- ...and probably more things on the road when the basic stuff done.
